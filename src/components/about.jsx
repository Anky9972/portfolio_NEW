            I'm a final year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) at Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior. Passionate about exploring the intersections of technology, I'm driven by a relentless curiosity to learn and grow. Proficient in web development, particularly in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks, I enjoy crafting intuitive web experiences. Eager to gain real-world experience, I aim to bridge the gap between AIML and web development to create innovative solutions. I thrive on challenges and am committed to leveraging my skills to contribute meaningfully to projects. Let's collaborate and create something extraordinary together!
